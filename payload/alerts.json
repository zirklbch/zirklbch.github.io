The new schedule, launching April 3, will provide service at least every 30 minutes during the morning and evening rush hours as well as hourly service at most stations during off peak hours. The 12 additional weekday trips will increase the line&rsquo;s total to 78 trips compared to 66 today and 65 before the pandemic.</p><p><br />Outbound service in the early evening rush is expanded with three new trains departing Chicago between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., including a 3:22 p.m. departure to McHenry that riders have requested.&nbsp; Arlington Heights riders will also have more express service in the morning and the evening rush hours with a new 7:25 a.m. inbound train and a 5:07 p.m. outbound train. The new schedule adds a reverse commute option for students at St. Viator High School in Arlington Heights, with a new 6:35 a.m. departure from Chicago.</p>","language":"en-US"}]}}}]
