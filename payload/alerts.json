Every rush period at Union Station relies on the smooth operation of a series of switches that allow for trains to use multiple routes to and from the platforms. Those switches are maintained by Amtrak, the owner of Chicago Union Station and the tracks and switches that approach the facility. Last night, a switch between the platforms and the yard used by BNSF and SWS trains failed. As a result, there were fewer routes available for trains to enter and exit the station, creating congestion and delays until the switch was repaired. Metra and Amtrak are meeting to look for ways to prevent a recurrence and to better handle similar situations.
